"""
Emergency Coordinator for GeoAgentic.

Contract (from agent-contracts.md):
  Input:  incident report (raw, from any citizen channel), timestamp.
  Output: {incident_id, severity, activated_agents[], status}
  
Responsibility: 
  Classify severity, decide which agents to activate (not every incident 
  needs every agent — e.g. a minor incident may skip Hospital Intelligence),
  and compile the final action plan once fusion completes.
