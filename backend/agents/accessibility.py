"""
Accessibility Agent for GeoAgentic.

Contract (from agent-contracts.md):
  Input:  raw citizen input via any modality (voice, sign-language video,
          text, SOS button, symbol tap).
  Output: {incident_report, citizen_accessibility_profile,
           input_modality, confidence}

This agent normalizes various input modalities (including mocked
sign-language parsing and unstructured text) into a standard
IncidentReport that the Decision Fusion Engine can consume.
