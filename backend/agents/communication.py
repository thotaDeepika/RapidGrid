"""
Communication Agent for GeoAgentic.

Contract (from agent-contracts.md):
  Input:  approved action plan
  Output: delivery receipts per channel {recipient, channel, status, timestamp}

Key rule:
  Never blocks the critical path — dispatch proceeds even if a notification
  channel fails; log and retry failures separately.
