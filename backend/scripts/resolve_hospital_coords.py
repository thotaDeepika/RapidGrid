"""
Resolve curated hospital coordinates against OpenStreetMap.

Why this exists
---------------
The hospital coordinates were originally hand-written from memory, and an audit
found 24 of 30 were more than 700 m out - St John's by 18 km, Sanjay Gandhi by
4.2 km, Ramaiah by 2.4 km. That is not a rounding problem: a patient with chest
pain standing at MSRIT was told Ramaiah Memorial was 10 minutes away when it is
595 m down the road, because the system was routing to a point in Malleswaram.

Hand-correcting 24 coordinates from memory would reintroduce the same class of
error. This resolves them from OSM instead, and writes the result into
data/hospital_capabilities.json so the coordinates live with the profile.

Matching is deliberately conservative
-------------------------------------
A loose matcher is worse than none: an early version paired "Apollo Hospital
(Bannerghatta Road)" with *Fortis* Bannerghatta, and "Mallya Hospital" with a
diagnostics centre of the same name. Candidates are scored on rare-token
overlap - "jayadeva" and "kidwai" identify a facility, "hospital" and
"bangalore" do not - and anything below the confidence floor is reported for a
human to check rather than silently written.
