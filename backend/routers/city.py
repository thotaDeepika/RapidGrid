"""
City state router - the intervention surface for the causal model.

These endpoints are `do()` operators. Closing a road here does not annotate a
map; it changes the cost of the network, so every route computed afterwards is
genuinely different, including routes for incidents that had already been
planned and had nothing to do with the closure.
